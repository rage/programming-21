Classes which contain only data attributes are not very different from dictionaries. Below you will find two ways to model a bank account, first with a class definition, and then using a dictionary.

```python
# Example 1: bank account with class definition
class BankAccount:

    def __init__(self, account_number: str, owner: str, balance: float, annual_interest: float):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance
        self.annual_interest = annual_interest

peters_account = BankAccount("12345-678", "Peter Python", 1500.0, 0.015)
```

```python
# Example 2: bank account with dictionary
peters_account = {"account_number": "12345-678", "owner": "Peter Python", "balance": 1500.0, "annual_interest": 0.0}
```

With a dictionary the implementation is much shorter and more straightforward. With a class, however, the structure is more "tightly bound", so that we can expect all `BankAccount` objects to be structurally alike. A class is also named. The `BankAccount` class is referenced when creating a new bank account, and the type of the object is `BankAccount`, not `dict`.

Another significant advantage of classes is that in addition to data, they can contain functionality. One of the guiding principles of object oriented programming is that an object is uswd to access both the data attached to an object and the functionality to process that data.

## Methods in classes

A method is a subprogram or function that is bound to a specific class. Usually a method only affects a single object. A method is defined within the class definition, and it can access the data attributes of the class just like any other variable.

Let's continue with the `BankAccount` class introduced above. Below we have a new method which adds interest to the account:

```python
class BankAccount:

    def __init__(self, account_number: str, owner: str, balance: float, annual_interest: float):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance
        self.annual_interest = annual_interest

    # This method adds the annual interest to the balance of the account
    def add_interest(self):
        self.balance += self.balance * self.annual_interest


peters_account = BankAccount("12345-678", "Peter Python", 1500.0, 0.015)
peters_account.add_interest()
print(peters_account.balance)
```

<sample-output>

1522.5

</sample-output>

The `add_interest` method multiplies the balance of the account by the annual interest percentage, and then adds the result to the current balance. The method acts only on the object which it is called on.

Let's see how this works when we have created multiple instances of the class:

```python
# The class BankAccount is defined in the previous example

peters_account = BankAccount("12345-678", "Peter Python", 1500.0, 0.015)
paulas_account = BankAccount("99999-999", "Paula Pythonen", 1500.0, 0.05)
pippas_account = BankAccount("1111-222", "Pippa Programmer", 1500.0, 0.001)

# Add interest on Peter's and Paula's accounts, but not on Pippa's
peters_account.add_interest()
paulas_account.add_interest()

# Print all account balances
print(peters_account.balance)
print(paulas_account.balance)
print(pippas_account.balance)
```

<sample-output>

1522.5
1575.0
1500.0

</sample-output>

As you can see above, the annual interest is added only to those accounts which the method is called on. As the annual interest rates are different for Peter's and Paula's accounts, the results are different for these two accounts. The balance on Pippa's account does not change, because the `add_interest` method is not called on the object `pippas_account`.

## Encapsulation

In object oriented programming the word _client_ comes up from time to time. This is used to refer to a section of code which creates an object and uses the service provided by its methods. When the data contained in an object is used only through the methods it provides, the _internal integrity_ of the object is guaranteed. In practice this means that, for example, a `BankAccount` class offers methods to handle the `balance` attribute, so the balance is never accessed directly by the client. These methods can then verify that the balance is not allowed to go below zero, for instance.

An example of how this would work:

```python
class BankAccount:

    def __init__(self, account_number: str, owner: str, balance: float, annual_interest: float):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance
        self.annual_interest = annual_interest

    # This method adds the annual interest to the balance of the account
    def add_interest(self):
        self.balance += self.balance * self.annual_interest

    # This method "withdraws" money from the account
    # If the withdrawal is successful the method returns True, and False otherwise
    def withdraw(self, amount: float):
        if amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            return True

        return False

peters_account = BankAccount("12345-678", "Peter Python", 1500.0, 0.015)

if peters_account.withdraw(1000):
    print("The withdrawal was successful, the balance is now", peters_account.balance)
else:
    print("The withdrawal was unsuccessful, the balance is insufficient")

# Yritetään uudestaan
if peters_account.withdraw(1000):
    print("The withdrawal was successful, the balance is now", peters_account.balance)
else:
    print("The withdrawal was unsuccessful, the balance is insufficient")
```

<sample-output>

The withdrawal was successful, the balance is now 500.0
The withdrawal was unsuccessful, the balance is insufficient

</sample-output>

Maintaining the internal integrity of the object and offering suitable methods to ensure this is called _encapsulation_. The idea is that the inner workings of the object are hidden from the client, but the object offers methods which can be used to access the data stored in the object.

Adding a method does not automatically hide the attribute. Even though the `BankAccount` class definition contains the `withdraw` method for withdrawing money, the client code can still access and change the `balance` attribute directly:

```python
peters_account = BankAccount("12345-678", "Peter Python", 1500.0, 0.015)

# Attempt to withdraw 2000
if peters_account.withdraw(2000):
    print("The withdrawal was successful, the balance is now", peters_account.balance)
else:
    print("The withdrawal was unsuccessful, the balance is insufficient")

    # "Force" the withdrawal of 2000
    peters_account.balance -= 2000

print("The balance is now:", peters_account.balance)
```

<sample-output>

The withdrawal was unsuccessful, the balance is insufficient
The balance is now: -500.0

</sample-output>

It is possible to hide the data attributes from the client code, which can help in solving this problem. We will return to this topic in the next part.

<programming-exercise name='Decreasing counter' tmcname='part08-10_decreasing_counter'>

This exercise has multiple parts. You can submit the parts separately. Each part is worth one exercise point.

The exercise template contains a partially completed class `DecreasingCounter`:

```python
class DecreasingCounter:
    def __init__(self, initial_value: int):
        self.value = initial_value

    def print_value(self):
        print("value:", self.value)

    def decrease(self):
        pass

    # define the rest of your methods here
```

The class can now be used as shown below, and should produce the following printout after completing the first part of the exercise:

```python
counter = DecreasingCounter(10)
counter.print_value()
counter.decrease()
counter.print_value()
counter.decrease()
counter.print_value()
```

<sample-output>

value: 10
value: 9
value: 8

</sample-output>


### Decreasing the value of the counter

Please complete the method `decrease` defined in the template, so that it decreases the value stored in the counter by one. See the example above for expected behaviour.

### The counter must not have a negative value

Please add functionality to your `decrease` method, so that the value of the counter will never reach negative values. If the value of the counter is 0, it will not be further decreased.

```python
counter = DecreasingCounter(2)
counter.print_value()
counter.decrease()
counter.print_value()
counter.decrease()
counter.print_value()
counter.decrease()
counter.print_value()
```

<sample-output>

value: 2
value: 1
value: 0
value: 0

</sample-output>

### Setting the value to zero

Please add a method `set_to_zero` which sets the value of the counter to 0:

```python
counter = DecreasingCounter(100)
counter.print_value()
counter.set_to_zero()
counter.print_value()
```

<sample-output>

value: 100
value: 0

</sample-output>

### Resetting the counter

Please add a method `reset_original_value()` which resets the counter to its initial state:

```python
counter = DecreasingCounter(55)
counter.decrease()
counter.decrease()
counter.decrease()
counter.decrease()
counter.print_value()
counter.reset_original_value()
counter.print_value()
```

<sample-output>

value: 51
value: 55

</sample-output>

</programming-exercise>

To finish off this section, lets have a look at a class which models the personal best of a player. The class definition contains separate validator methods which ascertain that the arguments passed are valid. The methods are called already within the constructor. This ensures the object created is internally sound.

```python
from datetime import date

class PersonalBest:

    def __init__(self, player: str, day: int, month: int, year: int, points: int):
        # Default values
        self.player = ""
        self.date_of_pb = date(1900, 1, 1)
        self.points = 0

        if self.name_ok(player):
            self.player = player

        if self.date_ok(day, month, year):
            self.date_of_pb = date(year, month, day)

        if self.points_ok(points):
            self.points = points

    # Helper methods to check the arguments are valid
    def name_ok(self, name: str):
        return len(name) >= 2 # Name should be at least two characters long

    def date_ok(self, day, month, year):
        try:
            date(year, month, day)
            return True
        except:
            # an exception is raised if the arguments are not
            return False

    def points_ok(self, points):
        return points >= 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result1 = PersonalBest("Peter", 1, 11, 2020, 235)
    print(result1.points)
    print(result1.player)
    print(result1.date_of_pb)

    # The date was not valid
    result2 = PersonalBest("Paula", 4, 13, 2019, 4555)
    print(result2.points)
    print(result2.player)
    print(result2.date_of_pb) # Tulostaa oletusarvon 1900-01-01
```

<sample-output>

235
Peter
2020-11-01
4555
Paula
1900-01-01

</sample-output>

In the example above also the helper methods were called via the `self` parameter name when they were used in the constructor. It is possible to also include _static_ method definitions in class definitions. These are methods which can be called without ever creating an instance of the class. We will return to this subject in the next part.

The parameter name `self` is only used when referring to the features of the _object as an instance of the class_. These include both the data attributes and the methods attached to an object. To make the terminology more confusing, the data attributes and methods are together sometimes referred to simply as the _attributes_ of the object, which is why in this material we have often specified _data attributes_ when we mean the variables defined within the class. This is where the terminology of some Python programmers slightly differs from the terminology used in object oriented programming more widely, where _attributes_ usually refers to just the data attributes of an object.

It is also possible to create local variables within method definitions without referring to `self`. You should do so if there is no need to access the variables outside the method. Local variables within methods have no special keywords; they are used just like any normal variables you have come across thus far.

So, for example this would work:

```python
class BonusCard:
    def __init__(self, name: str, balance: float):
        self.name = name
        self.balance = balance

    def add_bonus(self):
        # The variable bonus below is a local variable.
        # It is not a data attribute of the object.
        # It can not be accessed directly through the object.
        bonus = self.balance * 0.25
        self.balance += bonus

    def add_superbonus(self):
        # The superbonus variable is also a local variable.
        # Usually helper variables are local variables because
        # there is no need to access them from the other
        # methods in the class or directly through an object.
        superbonus = self.balance * 0.5
        self.balance += superbonus

    def __str__(self):
        return f"BonusCard(name={self.name}, balance={self.balance})"
```

<programming-exercise name="First and last name" tmcname='part08-11_first_and_last_name'>

Please write a class named `Person` with a _single attribute_ `name`, which is set with an argument given to the constructor.

Please also add two methods:

The method `return_first_name` should return the first name of the person, while the method `return_last_name` should return the last name of the person.

You may assume that the name passed to the constructor will contain exactly two name elements separated with a space character.

An example use case:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    peter = Person("Peter Pythons")
    print(peter.return_first_name())
    print(peter.return_last_name())

    paula = Person("Paula Pythonnen")
    print(paula.return_first_name())
    print(paula.return_last_name())
```

<sample-output>

Peter
Pythons
Paula
Pythonnen

</sample-output>


</programming-exercise>

<programming-exercise name='Statistics on numbers' tmcname='part08-12_number_stats'>

In this exercise you are asked to create a program for working with numbers, similarly to the exercise completed at the [end of part 2](/part-2/4-simple-loops#programming-exercise-working-with-numbers) in the Introduction to Programming course. This time you will define a class for the purpose.

### Count the numbers

Please write a class named `NumberStats` with the following methods:

- the method `add_number` adds a new number to the statistical record
- the method `count_numbers` returns the count of how many numbers have been added

At this point there is no need to store the numbers themselves in any data structure. It is enough to simply remember how many have been added. The `add_number` method does take an argument, but there is no need to process the actual value in any way just yet.

The exercise template contains the following skeleton for the class definition:

```python
class  NumberStats:
    def __init__(self):
        self.numbers = 0

    def add_number(self, number:int):
        pass

    def count_numbers(self):
        pass
```

```python
stats = NumberStats()
stats.add_number(3)
stats.add_number(5)
stats.add_number(1)
stats.add_number(2)
print("Numbers added:", stats.count_numbers())
```

<sample-output>

Numbers added: 4

</sample-output>

### The sum and the mean

Please add the following methods to your class definition:

- the method `get_sum` should return the sum of the numbers added (if no numbers have been added, the method should return 0)
- the method `average` should return the mean of the numbers added (if no numbers have been added, the method should return 0)

```python
stats = NumberStats()
stats.add_number(3)
stats.add_number(5)
stats.add_number(1)
stats.add_number(2)
print("Numbers added:", stats.count_numbers())
print("Sum of numbers:", stats.get_sum())
print("Mean of numbers:", stats.average())
```

<sample-output>

Numbers added: 4
Sum of numbers: 11
Mean of numbers: 2.75

</sample-output>

### User input

Please write a main program which keeps asking the user for integer numbers until the user types in -1. The program should then print out the sum and the mean of the numbers typed in.

Your program should use a `NumberStats` object to keep a record of the numbers added.

NB: you do not need to change the `NumberStats` class in this part of the exercise, provided it passed the tests for the previous part of the exercise. Use an instance of the class to complete this part.

NB2: your main program should not be contained in a `if __name__ == "__main__"` block, or the tests will not work.

<sample-output>

Please type in integer numbers:
**4**
**2**
**5**
**2**
**-1**
Sum of numbers: 13
Mean of numbers: 3.25

</sample-output>

### Multiple sums

Please add to your main program so that it also counts separately the sum of the even and the odd numbers added.

NB: do not change your `NumberStats` class definition in this part of exercise, either. Instead, define three `NumberStats` objects. One of them should keep track of all the numbers, another should track the even numbers, and the third should track the odd numbers typed in.

NB2: your main program should not be contained in a `if __name__ == "__main__"` block, or the tests will not work.

Please have look at this example of how your main function should work:

<sample-output>

Please type in integer numbers:
**4**
**2**
**5**
**2**
**-1**
Sum of numbers: 13
Mean of numbers: 3.25
Sum of even numbers: 8
Sum of odd numbers: 5

</sample-output>
